# University-Coursework
Projects I created during school (assignments or side work)

Applied Econometrics:
  A project to take a dataset and run econometric models and write an analysis. I chose housing prices in four major cities in California as well as factors like their gdp, median household income, unemployment rate, etc. There was not a single dataset for such so I had to create my own which was made through multiple individual datasets from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database. I ran linear models, probit/logit and graphs to emphasize my points
